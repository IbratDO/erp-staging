/**
 * The hover box on "Foydalanuvchi bo'yicha o'rtacha dona".
 *
 * A stacked chart draws one series per salesman across every weekday, so Recharts names all of
 * them on hover — including everyone who sold nothing that day. With a dozen staff that is eleven
 * lines of "0" around the one number the reader came for.
 *
 * Rows are dropped from the hover only. The series themselves stay, which is what keeps a person
 * on the same colour in every bar and keeps the legend complete — hiding a *series* would have
 * reshuffled the palette from one weekday to the next.
 *
 * Moved here with the chart cards themselves. They used to live inside `DashboardModern`, where
 * only the Founder and the Investor got the benefit of them; every other role's dashboard kept a
 * separate, older copy of the same chart. Sharing the components is what puts this hover in front
 * of the CEO and the sales managers too.
