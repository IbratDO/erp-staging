/**
 * One inventarizatsiya, as a file somebody can file.
 *
 * The rest of the app downloads tables by reading the rendered DOM (`utils/tableCsv`), and for a
 * page you are looking at that is the right way round — the file then matches the screen exactly.
 * A single count is the one case where it is not: the whole point of the download is the *detail*,
 * every layer the count judged, and the history page deliberately does not render that. Reading
 * the DOM would export the summary row and call it an audit record.
 *
 * So this builds the matrix from the report the API returns, and `tableCsv` still turns it into
 * the file. Splitting it here rather than inside the page keeps it testable without a browser, and
 * keeps the two exports on the page — the history list, and one count — from growing two different
 * ideas of what a CSV looks like.
 *
 * Everything is a string by the time it leaves here. The labels come in from the caller rather
 * than being looked up, because this module has no business knowing which language the shop reads.
