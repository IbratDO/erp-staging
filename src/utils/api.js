/**
 * Collapse a repeated write while the first one is still in the air.
 *
 * The shop's buttons take a moment to come back — paying an order moves cash, writes finance
 * records and re-splits freight before it answers — and a button that looks untouched invites
 * a second click. That second click used to become a second request, and a second request on a
 * money endpoint is a second payment.
 *
 * So while a write is in flight, an identical one — same method, same URL, same body — is
 * handed the *first* one's promise instead of being sent. The caller cannot tell: it waits and
 * receives the same answer, so the screen refreshes and the success message appears exactly as
 * it should, because the operation genuinely did succeed. Once.
 *
 * The window is only the flight itself. As soon as the first request settles the key is
 * released, so deliberately doing the same thing twice — refunding two identical instalments,
 * adding the same expense again — is never blocked. Nobody can click faster than the network
 * on purpose.
 *
 * Reads are left alone: fetching the same list twice is wasteful, not harmful, and callers
 * expect their own response object.
 *
 * **This is a guard, not a guarantee.** It lives in one browser tab and dies with it: a
 * refresh mid-request, a second tab, or two people on one account can still produce two
 * genuine requests. Only the server can rule that out, and for the endpoints where it matters
 * it already does — paying an order, paying cargo and selling from an order all refuse a
 * repeat outright. `manage.py audit_repeat_guards` lists the ones that do not.
 *
 * Creating orders and sales is deliberately not among them. A general "refuse an identical
 * body twice" guard was built and removed: two identical sales are a real thing a shop does,
 * the server cannot tell one from a misfired click, and refusing real trading is the worse
 * error of the two. The browser guards above are the right place for this, because only the
 * browser knows the two requests came from one gesture.
