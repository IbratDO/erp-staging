/**
 * Collapsing a double-clicked write.
 *
 * The complaint these tests come from: a button that moves money takes a moment to answer, so
 * it looks untouched, so it gets clicked again — and a second request on a money endpoint is a
 * second payment. While the first write is in the air an identical one must not be sent.
 *
 * The tests drive the real axios instance and swap only its adapter, so what is exercised is
 * the wrapper as shipped rather than a re-description of it. Counting adapter calls is the
 * whole point: it is the number of requests that actually left the browser.
